This is murder, inasmuch as the provocation was not given by the child, and the death of the child was not caused by accident or misfortune in doing an act caused by the provocation.\n(b)Y gives grave and sudden provocation to A. A, on this provocation, fires a pistol at Y, neither intending nor knowing himself to be likely to kill Z, who is near him, but out of sight. A kills Z. Here A has not committed murder but merely culpable homicide.\n(c)A is lawfully arrested by Z, a police officer. A is excited to sudden and violent passion by the arrest, and kills Z. This is murder, inasmuch as the provocation was given by a thing done by a public servant in the exercise of his powers.\n(d)A appears as a witness before Z, a Magistrate. Z says that he does not believe a word of A\u2019s deposition, and that A has perjured himself. A is moved to sudden passion by these words, and kills Z. This is murder.\n(e)A attempts to pull Z\u2019s nose. Z, in the exercise of the right of private defence, lays hold of A to prevent him from doing so. A is moved to sudden and violent passion in consequence, and kills Z. This is murder, inasmuch as the provocation was given by a thing done in the exercise of the right of private defence.\n(f)Z strikes B. B is by this provocation excited to violent rage. A, a bystander, intending to take advantage of B\u2019s rage, and to cause him to kill Z, puts a knife into B\u2019s hand for that purpose. B kills Z with the knife.

Here, if A\u2019s intention be dishonestly to take the dog out of Z\u2019s possession without Z\u2019s consent, A has committed theft as soon as Z\u2019s dog has begun to follow A.\n(c)[Deleted by Act 51 of 2007]\n(d)A, being Z\u2019s servant and entrusted by Z with the care of Z\u2019s plate, dishonestly runs away with the plate without Z\u2019s consent. A has committed theft.\n(e)Z, going on a journey, entrusts his plate to A, the keeper of a warehouse, till Z shall return. A carries the plate to a goldsmith and sells it. Here the plate was not in Z\u2019s possession. It could not, therefore, be taken out of Z\u2019s possession, and A has not committed theft, though he may have committed criminal breach of trust.\n(f)A finds a ring belonging to Z on a table in the house which Z occupies. Here the ring is in Z\u2019s possession, and if A dishonestly removes it, A commits theft.\n(g)A finds a ring lying on the high road, not in the possession of any person. A by taking it commits no theft, though he may commit criminal misappropriation of property.\n(h)A sees a ring belonging to Z lying on a table in Z\u2019s house. Not venturing to misappropriate the ring immediately for fear of search and detection, A hides the ring in a place where it is highly improbable that it will ever be found by Z, with the intention of taking the ring from the hiding place and selling it when the loss is forgotten. Here A, at the time of first moving the ring, commits theft.\n(i)A delivers his watch to Z, a jeweller, to be regulated. Z carries it to his shop. A, not owing to the jeweller any debt for which the jeweller might lawfully detain the watch as a security, enters the shop openly, takes his watch by force out of Z\u2019s hand, and carries it away. Here A, though he may have committed criminal trespass and assault, has not committed theft, inasmuch as what he did was not done dishonestly.\n(j)If A owes money to Z for repairing the watch, and if Z retains the watch lawfully as a security for the debt, and A takes the watch out of Z\u2019s possession, with the intention of depriving Z of the property as a security for his debt, he commits theft, inasmuch as he takes it dishonestly.\n(k)Again, if A having pawned his watch to Z, takes it out of Z\u2019s possession without Z\u2019s consent, not having paid what he borrowed on the watch, he commits theft, though the watch is his own property, inasmuch as he takes it dishonestly.\n(l)A takes an article belonging to Z out of Z\u2019s possession, without Z\u2019s consent, with the intention of keeping it until he obtains money from Z as a reward for its restoration. Here A takes dishonestly; A has therefore committed theft.\n(m)A, being on friendly terms with Z, goes into Z\u2019s library in Z\u2019s absence and takes away a book, without Z\u2019s express consent, for the purpose merely of reading it, and with the intention of returning it.

She gives A valuable property, which A knows to belong to her husband Z, and to be such property as she has no authority from Z to give. If A takes the property dishonestly, he commits theft.\n(p)A in good faith, believing property belonging to Z to be A\u2019s own property, takes that property out of B\u2019s possession.

A, in order to defraud B, adds a cypher to the 1,000, and makes the sum $10,000, intending that it may be believed by B that Z so wrote the letter. A has committed forgery.\n(b)A, without Z\u2019s authority, affixes Z\u2019s seal to a document, purporting to be a conveyance of an estate from Z to A, with the intention of selling the estate to B, and thereby of obtaining from B the purchase money. A has committed forgery.\n(c)A picks up a cheque on a banker signed by B, payable to bearer, but without any sum having been inserted in the cheque. A fraudulently fills up the cheque by inserting the sum of $1,000. A commits forgery.\n(d)A leaves with B, his agent, a cheque on a banker, signed by A, without inserting the sum payable, and authorises B to fill up the cheque by inserting a sum not exceeding $1,000 for the purpose of making certain payments. B fraudulently fills up the cheque by inserting the sum of $10,000. B commits forgery.\n(e)A draws a bill of exchange on himself in the name of B without B\u2019s authority, intending to discount it as a genuine bill with a banker, and intending to take up the bill on its maturity. Here, as A draws the bill with intent to deceive the banker by leading him to suppose that he had the security of B, and thereby to discount the bill, A is guilty of forgery.\n(f)Z\u2019s will contains these words: I direct that all my remaining property be equally divided between A, B and C. A dishonestly scratches out B\u2019s name, intending that it may be believed that the whole was left to himself and C. A has committed forgery.\n(g)A endorses a promissory note and makes it payable to Z, or his order, by writing on the bill the words Pay to Z or his order, and signing the endorsement. B dishonestly erases the words Pay to Z, or his order, and thereby converts the special endorsement into a blank endorsement. B commits forgery.\n(h)A sells and conveys an estate to Z. A afterwards, in order to defraud Z of his estate, executes a conveyance of the same estate to B, dated 6 months earlier than the date of the conveyance to Z, intending it to be believed that he had conveyed the estate to B before he conveyed it to Z. A has committed forgery.\n(i)Z dictates his will to A. A intentionally writes down a different legatee from the legatee named by Z, and by representing to Z that he has prepared the will according to his instructions, induces Z to sign the will. A has committed forgery.\n(j)A writes a letter and signs it with B\u2019s name without B\u2019s authority, certifying that A is a man of good character and in distressed circumstances from unforeseen misfortune, intending by means of such letter to obtain alms from Z and other persons. Here, as A made a false document in order to induce Z to part with property, A has committed forgery.\n(k)A without B\u2019s authority writes a letter and signs it in B\u2019s name, certifying to A\u2019s character, intending thereby to obtain employment under Z.

A is guilty of forgery; and if B knowing the fact draws the bill upon the paper pursuant to A\u2019s intention, B is also guilty of forgery.\n(c)A picks up a bill of exchange payable to the order of a different person of the same name. A endorses the bill in his own name, intending to cause it to be believed that it was endorsed by the person to whose order it was payable: here A has committed forgery.\n(d)A purchases an estate sold under execution of a decree against B. B after the seizure of the estate, in collusion with Z, executes a lease of the estate to Z at a nominal rent and for a long period, and dates the lease 6 months prior to the seizure with intent to defraud A, and to cause it to be believed that the lease was granted before the seizure. B, though he executes the lease in his own name, commits forgery by antedating it.\n(e)A, a trader, in anticipation of insolvency, lodges effects with B for A\u2019s benefit, and with intent to defraud his creditors, and in order to give a colour to the transaction, writes a promissory note binding himself to pay to B a sum for value received, and antedates the note, intending that it may be believed to have been made before A was on the point of insolvency.
